    <h2>Welcome to EcoBites, your restaurant for clean, healthy, vegetarian eating!</h2>
    <p>Our mission at EcoBites is to provide clean, healthy eating for our customers. In today's world, it's getting harder and harder
    for people to get the nutrients they need. Lots of stores and restaurants have processed foods, and they don't provide customers with clean,
    organic foods. At EcoBites, we specialize in vegetarian dishes at affordable costs. We believe that everyone deserves the chance to
    eat healthy, regardless of if they're vegetarian or not. Stop by our restaurant, or place an online order today!</p>
